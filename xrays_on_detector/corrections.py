"""Per-pixel geometric intensity corrections for reciprocal-space reconstruction.

These convert raw detector counts into an intensity proportional to the scattered
intensity per unit solid angle, correcting the two pixel-dependent geometric
effects on a flat detector:

* solid angle (obliquity): a flat-detector pixel of fixed area A subtends a solid
  angle dOmega = A cos^3(alpha) / L^2, where alpha is the angle between the ray to
  the pixel and the detector normal (the beam) and L the sample-detector distance.
  To recover intensity per steradian, multiply counts by 1/cos^3(alpha) (= 1 on
  axis, growing towards the corners).

* polarisation: Thomson scattering of a (partially) polarised beam attenuates the
  scattered intensity by a pixel-dependent factor. For a beam with fraction p
  linearly polarised along the in-plane horizontal unit vector h (and 1-p along
  the vertical v), the factor is
      P = p (1 - (h . khat)^2) + (1 - p) (1 - (v . khat)^2),
  where khat is the outgoing unit direction. Multiply counts by 1/P.

The Lorentz factor is deliberately NOT included. In a rotation-scan reconstruction
that normalises each voxel by its number of contributing pixels, the varying time
a reciprocal-space point spends on the Ewald sphere appears as a varying pixel
count, so dividing by the count already applies the geometric Lorentz correction.
This is the Meerkat (A. Simonov) convention: correct only the per-pixel photometric
factors here, and let the count normalisation handle the sampling geometry.

Assumption for a synchrotron source (e.g. Diamond I19-2): the beam is polarised in
the horizontal plane, taken here as the detector `fast` axis. If the instrument's
horizontal is the `slow` axis, pass horizontal=detector.slow. Polarisation is a
few-percent effect at these angles, but the axis choice should be confirmed.
